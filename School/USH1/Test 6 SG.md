# Federalists vs. Anti-Federalists
- Argument to **ratify the Constitution**

| Federalists | Anti-Federalists |
| ---- | ---- |
| Support federal union | Small republic<br>- Govt close to people<br>- Promoted popular participation<br>- States best protects right of people, carries out primary business of government<br>- National government simply exists to give the states an **external strength** they can't have on their own |
| Ratification of new Constitution | Saw new Constitution as **aristocratic**, against new Constitution |
| Merchants, businessmen, large property owners, lawyers, judges<br>- Mostly people that will benefit from a strong union | Farmers, rural artisans, laborers, shopkeepers<br>- Localists |
| Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, James Madison | Patrick Henry, George Mason, George Clinton |
| Federalist Papers<br>- Collection of papers supporting Federalists, shows organization of Federalists > Antifederalists | Bill of Rigthts |

- AF pushes for **Bill of Rights**
	- First 10 amendments
- All 13 states vote to ratify
	- **Filter of Representative Government** = Some states have landslides, some states have very close elections
	- Passed in **1791**
- Faction = Single interest group
	- Building blocks of political parties
	- Parties get as many factions that believe similar things under their umbrella
- Large republic
	- Many different environments --> more cultures --> more political ideas

# Bill of Rights
## AF arguments against BoR
- Impossible to list all rights
- An evil govt could argue that b/c a right is not listed, that right does not exist for the people
## A1
- **Establishment Clause** = No official religion
	- Freedom of Religion
	- CANNOT do anything that harms others in the name of religion
- Freedom of speech
	- Exceptions:
	- **Slander** = **Knowingly** telling lies with the **intent** to **defame**
	- Schenck v. United States - https://www.oyez.org/cases/1900-1940/249us47
		- Analogous to "yelling 'Fire' in a crowded theater"
		- A1 does not protect speech that approaches **creating** a **clear and present danger**
	- Brandenburg v. Ohio - https://www.oyez.org/cases/1968/492
		- Speech can be prohibited IF:
		1. It is directed at inciting or producing **imminent lawless action**
		2. It is **likely** to **incite** or **produce** such an action
		- E.g Large influencer tells people to burn down a school
- Freedom of press

		- If there is an illegal search and the police acquire evidence during the search, the evidence cannot be used in court
- Warrants
	- Must be **specific**, limited by **time and place**

## A5
- Require **Grand Jury** to put someone on trial for a capital crime
	- **Grand Jury** = A jury used by **prosecutors** to confirm that a case has enough evidence to begin prosecution
	- EXCEPT in emergency (war or public danger)
- **Double Jeopardy** = Can't be tried for the same crime twice
- **No self-incrimination**

# Hamilton's Financial Plan
- Issues with US economy
	- **National** and **state** debt
	- Currency - What backs a dollar?
		- Undervalued bonds
	- Trade issues with British
## Redemption Plan
- Ensures US has **good credit** for future loaans
- US redeem at **face value (actual price)** $55M in bonds held by foreign and domestic investors to **increase confidence**
- Would award **speculators** that took the risk of buying many bonds at market value (discounted values)
- Paid by taking out new loans/bonds
	- Take out new loans to pay old loans


## Assumption Plan
- Federal government add another $22M to national debt by **paying of debt of states** (assume state debt)
- **Increase confidence** in state's ability to pay off future loans
- Southern states opposed this b/c they had already paid off their debts
	- War was largely held and financed in northern states
	- Would benefit northern states

## Compromise
- To gain Southern support, Hamilton proposes the nation's capital be built along the Potomac River between VA and MD (more in South)

## Bank of US
- Hamilton asks Congress to charter **federal** **Bank of US**
	- Jointly owned by private stockholders and Federal government
	- Bank can handle government funds
	- Make loans to merchants
	- Promote trade and economic growth
	- Encourage investment
- Jefferson and Madison opposes the plan, stating it is an **overly broad** interpretation of the Constitution
- Bank is made with a **20 year charter**
- **Excise tax** = Tax levied at the moment of manufacture of a good, **built into the price** on **whiskey** made in US (whiskey tax)
	- Tariffs on imported goods (promote US manufacturing)
- **Report on Manufactures (1791)** - Hamilton and Federalists encourage growth of US manufacturing

# Differing Visions of America
- North = Hamiltonians --> Federalists
- South = Madison + Jefferson --> Democratic-Republicans

| Federalists | Democratic-Republicans |
| ---- | ---- |
| Manufacturing + trade economy<br>Manufacturing + trade as basis of national wealth and power for a **meritocracy** | Opposed manufacturing, believed wage labor did not create political, social, and economic **independence** for citizens in a republic<br><br>Envisioned **yeoman** (middle class landowners) farmers (south + west) |
| Pro Tariffs (encourage US manufacturing) | Anti Tariff<br><br>Argument: Tariffs go against the idea of a free market, Federal govt should not be helping domestic businesses<br>Make a better business instead of tariffs |
| Pro Britain (trade) | Pro France |
| More federal power | State's rights |
| Loose interpretation of Constitution (more federal power) | Strict interpretation of Constitution (more state power) |
| Hamilton | Thomas Jefferrson |
