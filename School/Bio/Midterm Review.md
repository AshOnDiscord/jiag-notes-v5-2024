# Ch 3 - Water
- Water held together by **polar covalent bonds**
	- Water is **polar**

## Emergent Properties

### Cohesion and Adhesion
- Hydrogen bonds
- Surface tension = Measure of how difficult it is to stretch or break the surface of a liquid
- Adhesion = Clinging of one substance to another

- Adhesion + Cohesion = Water transport in plants

### Moderation of Temperature
- **Temperature** = **average** KE of molecules in body of matter
	- Regardless of volume
- **Thermal energy** = **total** KE
	- Depends on matter's volume
	- **Heat** = Transfer of thermal energy
- Swimming pool's thermal energy > Coffee's thermal energy
- Coffee's temperature > Swimming pool's temperature

#### Calories
- 1 cal = amount of heat to raise the temperature of 1 g of water by 1$^{\circ}$C
- 1 kcal = 1000 cal = amount of heat to raise one 1 kg of water by 1$^{\circ}$C
- 1 J (Joule) = 0.239 cal, 1 cal = 4.184 J

### Specific Heat
- **Specific heat** = **Amount of heat** that must be **absorbed** or **lost** for that substance to **change temperature** by 1$^{\circ}$**C**
	- SpH of water is 1 cal per gram per degree C
	- $1 \text{cal}/(g\cdot ^{\circ}C)$
	- Water has **high SpH**
	- $0.6 \text{cal}/(g \cdot ^{\circ}C)$ = 0.6 cal is required to raise temperature of 1 g of **ethyl alcohol** by 1$^{\circ}$C
	- B/c of hydrogen bonds = heat must be absorbed to break hydrogen bonds
	- Water acts to **moderate temperature in coastal areas** by absorbing heat during the daytime and releasing heat at night

### Evaporative Cooling
- **Heat of vaporization** = Quantity of heat a liquid must absorb to convert 1 g of it to a gas
- For water
	- Temperature moderation
	- Organismal cooling (evaporative cooling)
		- **Sweat**


### Ice floats
- Hydrogen bonds = **higher level of structural order**
	- Esp when frozen --> ice becomes **crystalline structure**

### Universal Solvent
- Solvent (dissolving agent) + solute (substance being dissolved) = **solution**
	- Must be **homogeneous**
- **Aqueous solution** when **solvent = water**
- **Hydration shell**

## Concentration Calculations
- Molecular mass = sum of the masses of all the atoms in the molecule
$$C_{12} H_{22} O_{11} = (12 \times 11) + (22 \times 1) + (11\times 16) = 342\;\text{daltons}$$
- **Mole (mol)** = Exact number of objects (similar to "dozen" = 12)
	- $6.02 \times 10^{23}$ molecules = 1 mol
	- $6.02 \times 10^{23}$ daltons in 1 g
- 1 mol of sucrose = 342 g of sucrose
- **Molarity (M)** = mols of solute per liter of solution
- 1M solution of sucrose:
	- Get 1 mol of sucrose = 342 g of sucrose
	- Dissolve 1 mol of sucrose in enough water to bring the **total** volume up to 1 L


## Acids and Bases
- **Dissociation of water** = Hydrogen atom participating in hydrogen bond can shift from one water molecule to the other, leaves it electron behind
	- Transfer of $H+$ ion
	- $$2 H_2O \leftrightarrow H_3O^+ + OH^-$$
	- By convention: $H^+ = H_3O^+$\
- Adding solutes (acid/base) disrupt the **dynamic equilibrium** of $H^+$ and $OH^-$

- Acid = **increases $H^+$ concentration**
- Base = **decreases $H^+$ concentration**
