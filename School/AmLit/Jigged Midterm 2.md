The Great Gatsby

Key Events:

Nick Carraway moves to the East Coast to work as a bond trader in Manhattan. He rents a small house in West Egg, a nouveau riche town in Long Island. In East Egg, the next town over, where old money people live, Nick reconnects with his cousin Daisy Buchanan, her husband Tom, and meets their friend Jordan Baker.

Tom takes Nick to meet his mistress, Myrtle Wilson. Myrtle is married to George Wilson, who runs a gas station in a gross and dirty neighborhood in Queens. Tom, Nick, and Myrtle go to Manhattan, where she hosts a small party that ends with Tom punching her in the face.

Nick meets his next-door neighbor, Jay Gatsby, a very rich man who lives in a giant mansion and throws wildly extravagant parties every weekend, and who is a mysterious person no one knows much about. His initial impression of Gatsby is that he is lonely.

Gatsby takes Nick to lunch and introduces him to his business partner - a gangster named Meyer Wolfsheim.

Nick starts a relationship with Jordan. Through her, Nick finds out that Gatsby and Daisy were in love five years ago, and that Gatsby would like to see her again.

Nick arranges for Daisy to come over to his house so that Gatsby can "accidentally" drop by. Daisy and Gatsby start having an affair.

Tom and Daisy come to one of Gatsby's parties. Daisy is disgusted by the ostentatiously vulgar display of wealth, and Tom immediately sees that Gatsby's money most likely comes from crime.

We learn that Gatsby was born into a poor farming family as James Gatz. He has always been extremely ambitious, creating the Jay Gatsby persona as a way of transforming himself into a successful self-made man—the ideal of the American Dream (Aspirational)

Nick, Gatsby, Daisy, Tom, and Jordan get together for lunch. At this lunch, Daisy and Gatsby are planning to tell Tom that she is leaving him. Gatsby suddenly feels uncomfortable doing this in Tom's house, and Daisy suggests going to Manhattan instead.

In Manhattan, the five of them get a suite at the Plaza Hotel where many secrets come out. Gatsby reveals that Daisy is in love with him. Tom in turn reveals that Gatsby is a bootlegger, and is probably engaged in other criminal activities as well. Gatsby demands that Daisy renounce Tom entirely, and say that she has never loved him. Daisy can't bring herself to say this because it isn't true, crushing Gatsby's dream and obsession. It's clear that their relationship is over and that Daisy has chosen to stay with Tom.

- Moment where Gatsby is revealed as a liar and wants extreme control over himself and his past

That evening, Daisy and Gatsby drive home in his car, with Daisy behind the wheel. When they drive by the Wilson gas station, Myrtle runs out to the car because she thinks it's Tom driving by. Daisy hits and kills her, driving off without stopping.

Nick, Jordan, and Tom investigate the accident. Tom tells George Wilson that the car that struck Myrtle belongs to Gatsby, and George decides that Gatsby must also be Myrtle's lover.

That night, Gatsby decides to take the blame for the accident. He is still waiting for Daisy to change her mind and come back to him, but she and Tom skip town the next day. Nick breaks up with Jordan because she is completely unconcerned about Myrtle's death.

Gatsby tells Nick some more of his story. As an officer in the army, he met and fell in love with Daisy, but after a month had to ship out to fight in WWI. Two years later, before he could get home, she married Tom. Gatsby has been obsessed with getting Daisy back since he shipped out to fight five years earlier.

The next day, George Wilson shoots and kills Gatsby, and then himself.

The police leave the Buchanans and Myrtle's affair out of the report on the murder-suicide.

Nick tries to find people to come to Gatsby's funeral, but everyone who pretended to be Gatsby's friend and came to his parties now refuses to come. Even Gatsby's partner Wolfshiem doesn't want to go to the funeral. Wolfshiem explains that he first gave Gatsby a job after WWI and that they have been partners in many illegal activities together.

Gatsby's father comes to the funeral from Minnesota. He shows Nick a self-improvement plan that Gatsby had written for himself as a boy.

Disillusioned with his time on the East coast, Nick decides to return  to his home in the Midwest.

Character Profiles:

Gatsby:

- Selfish = He expects Daisy to renounce her entire life with Tom
- Obsessive = He is obsessed with Daisy’s wealth, which is what he values her for (at one point he literally says that her voice is full of money). He rarely takes Daisy’s feelings into account and can’t accept the fact that her life has changed - we see this when he has an extreme realization after seeing her child)
- Aspirational and Borderline Delusional = As we saw when he reveals his backstory, Gatsby tries to construct a perfect version of himself (Jay Gatsby rather than James Gatz) and constantly chases after that vision. Even in his relationship with Daisy, he thinks he can repeat the past and fix all of his mistakes. Ultimately, as we reach the end of the book, we see that this idea of a “green light” is the American Dream which we can never really attain.
- Motivation could also be seen as a good thing because he wants to achieve his goals
- Obsession for Control: Gatsby is obsessed with the past because he wants to reclaim control over his life and Daisy’s life. He wants to make the past good times as his present.
- BUT (potential comparison with Frank!!!) although he is controlled by his desire to be with Daisy (like Frank is with Helen) he actually cares about Daisy’s wellbeing, as shown when he takes the blame for Myrtle’s death (and Frank doesn’t care about hurting Helen as long as he’s satisfying himself)
- In terms of judgment, he has good judgment because he is smart but morally he has bad judgment

Nick:

- Unreliable Narrator
- Gullible/Too trusting (of Gatsby specifically) - Refuses to believe that Gatsby was a bootlegger
- Claims that he’s the most honest person he’s ever known
- Says in the beginning of the book that he tries not to judge people then spends the rest of the book judging people (hypocritical)

Daisy:

- Materialistic & Obsessed with her place in Society = when Gatsby shows his collection of shirts, Daisy breaks down into tears because it shows that Gatsby is wealthy, and she regrets not waiting for him during the war. When Daisy goes to Gatsby’s party, she is repulsed at the vulgar and ostentatious people that are associated with “new money”. Eventually, her decision to stay with Tom reflects her reluctance to part with her place in society (“Old money”)
- Weak and indecisive- after Gatsby leaves she needs “some force to shape her life” and immediately goes along with Tom when he becomes that force and proposes to her
- Also kind of selfish- lets Gatsby take the blame for killing Myrtle and doesn't even own up to it when Wilson shows up at her house and Tom tells him that it was Gatsby

Tom:

- Inconsiderate = Tom seems to think that he can do whatever he wants (dominance) without considering the consequences. "And what's more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time”
- Jealous = Tom felt threatened by Gatsby’s wealth and the fact that he is popular and successful, which is why he led a full investigation to knock him down (assert dominance)

Jordan:

Olive Kitteridge

Key Events:

Pharmacy-

Henry Kitteridge is a pharmacist who hires a shop assistant, Denise. Jerry McCarthy is a delivery boy at the shop, and Denise encourages him to go back to school and improve his life. One day, Denise’s husband is killed in a hunting accident. With her being widowed, Henry takes it upon himself to teach Denise things like how to drive or how to write a check. Henry even finds her a kitten to raise. However, Denise runs over it with her car in an accident a year later, and she is heartbroken. Henry, again, tries to comfort her. Henry considers leaving Olive and staying with Denise, but then dismisses it as unthinkable. Denise ends up marrying Jerry, who ends up being fairly successful. Denise and Jerry move away, though Denise continues to send Henry notes on his birthday. When Denise writes one day saying how blessed she feels for her life, Henry feels a sense of loss. He realizes he secretly felt a connection to her all these years, though Denise truly moved on.

A Little Burst

At 38, Christopher Kitteridge (son of Olive and Henry) gets married to a nice woman and gastroenterologist, Suzanne Bernstein, after only knowing her for about six weeks. After the wedding at Suzanne and Christopher’s house, Olive wants to go home and worries about Christopher’s future happiness. She thinks about life and the fact that people need both big bursts of happiness and little bursts of happiness to be happy. Olive overhears Suzanne talking to a friend privately about Christopher’s difficult childhood, and Olive feels indignant. (Suzanne also comments about her dress.) Olive thinks about how much she loves her son. She remembers not too long ago she took him to get medicine for his depression. Angrily, Olive goes to the closet and steals Suzanne’s clothes. Olive contents herself with giving Suzanne this minor inconvenience of missing clothes — and gives herself a little burst of happiness — and leaves.

A Different Road

Olive reflects on something that happened one night, when Olive is 69 and Henry is 68. Christopher has recently moved to California with his new wife. Olive and Henry had had dinner with their friends Bill and Bunny Newton. Afterwards, Olive needed to go to the bathroom, so they stopped at the hospital to use their restroom. However, at the hospital they keep asking her questions about her health when she says she has diarrhea. As she’s waiting on the doctor, two masked men (Pig-Face and Blue-Mask) with guns show up looking for drugs. They force Olive and Henry into the hospital bathroom, where they are held hostage.

As they are sitting there, Olive and Henry erupt into an argument when a nurse starts to pray. Olive criticizes his mother (Pauline) for her brand of intolerant, judgmental Christianity. Olive reminds Henry of how Pauline referred to Olive’s father’s suicide as a sin. Olive also says that perhaps the reason Christopher moved away was because he married a Jewish woman and was worried Henry would be judgmental. Henry then counters, saying that Christopher left because Olive has always suffocated him. After the ordeal is over, Olive realizes their relationship will always be a little different, not because of being held hostage, but because of what they said to each other that night.

Tulips

Olive and Henry’s son, Christopher, announces that he’s getting a divorce roughly a year after the marriage, but he intends to stay in California. (Olive recalls a conversation about tulips, and how their ability to bloom lies in its bulb. It’s a reminder that power ultimately lies from within.) Henry soon suffers a stroke. He’s alive, but not responsive and paralyzed so he’s moved to a nursing home. In their house alone, Olive feels lonely. Olive notices a kind note from Louise Larkin one day, noting what a nice man Henry was. Roger and Louise Larkin are a couple that lives in town, but are now shut-ins that are rarely spotted following an unfortunate incident (it’s implied that their son murdered a woman by stabbing her to death). It prompts her to visit the Larkins, though the visit is creepy and tense. Olive wants to tell someone about it, so she goes to see Henry. Olive realizes on some level that she only went to see Louise, who she never really liked, in order to make herself feel better about her own life. Olive now recognizes it was wrong for her to desire it. The story ends with Olive deciding whether or not to plant tulips again.

Security

Olive Kitteridge, at 72, goes on a trip to New York to see Christopher. Christopher has now remarried to a woman named Ann, and now has two stepchildren. Ann is pregnant and Christopher needs help, so he asks Olive to please come to stay. In New York, the house is chaotic, but Ann is open and friendly (but she smokes while pregnant). Upstairs, a family with the surname O’Casey is subletting the unit. Olive wonders if they are related to Jim O’Casey, a former colleague of hers that Olive had fallen for, but never physically cheated with. Like Olive, Jim had been married with children. However, Jim was killed in a car accident before anything transpired between them, and Olive had grieved for him. The visit is going well, and Olive is feeling happy until she notices that she spilled butterscotch sauce over herself and no one told her. She thinks to herself that they must think of her as a useless old woman and is suddenly irritable and determined to leave.

- Unreasonable
- Seeking Attention

Christopher tries to coax Olive into telling him what’s going on, but Olive throws an outburst. Christopher tells Olive that her suddenly changing moods were difficult for him growing up, but Olive refuses to engage. Christopher then simply helps her leave, saying he’s not going to let her make him feel bad about it any more. At the airport, Olive considers calling Christopher to patch things up, but then changes her mind. When the airport officials ask her to take off her shoes, she refuses and the airport security is called over.

Character Profiles

Olive:

- Bad Communicator - similar reasons to “Uncontrollable Anger”
- Uncontrollable Anger - Olive’s explosive reaction (stealing Suzanne’s clothes), Explosion at Christopher for not getting attention in Security
- Concerned for her Family - In A Little Burst, she is concerned that Christopher is getting married too quickly and that Suzanne is not the right person for her
- Attention-Seeking
- Superiority Complex: likes to think that she’s better than other people, shown when she says Chris will not turn out like Louise’s son (forgot his name) because she raised him (his “bulb” grew in her “soil”)

Henry:

- Selfish: cares more about himself than this family (emotional affair with Denise, wants to appear good for church without caring how tired Olive is from doing all the housework)

Christopher:

- Abandons Olive
- Doesn’t really care when Henry has a stroke (he does go to Maine and help though)
- Passive (in a good way, probably learned to be the most mentally stable person in Olive): doesn’t get overly concerned with confrontations (in argument with Olive, he was just washing dishes and didn’t get rlly upset)

The Assistant

Key Events:

- Morris moves to Brooklyn from Russia and meets his wife in NY. They have a grocery store but it was hit hard after another grocery store opened (property owned by Karp). They also take some of Helen’s wages.
- Helen runs into Nat Pearl, a neighbor studying in college to be a lawyer, on the subway. She recalls how she used to be dating Nat and then started cutting him off after she began hating herself for agreeing to sleep with him twice, then declares her plan to save up to attend college herself at NYU.
- Two men (Frank and Ward) rob Morris’s store and hit Morris on the head; Morris blacks out thinking it’s just his fate as an unlucky poor grocer.
- Frank then comes into the store later and pretends as if he is new. He claims he has had a rough life and wants a new beginning. Frank helps Morris and eventually asks Morris if he could work for free to learn storekeeping. Morris says no and Frank “disappears” but Morris notices milk and rolls are being stolen. Morris finds Frank sleeping in his cellar, and Frank admits to stealing out of hunger, but Morris lets it go.
- Morris slips while dragging in milk and passes out, Frank rescues him and starts working in the store.
- Frank brings in much more money than Morris ever did during the week Morris was recovering. Business is SO successful that Morris wants to pay Frank, but Frank has been stealing money (and also it was him and Ward that held up the store) and doesn’t feel good to take it.
- Frank is interested in Helen and keeps meeting her in the library. They eventually kiss. Helen makes it difficult for Frank because she says she will not have sex with someone unless she’s 100% sure she loves him.
- Morris enjoys working with Frank, however starts to see money not equal to what it should be. Frank at the same time is guilty about the whole thing and repay everything, and puts $6 in the register. But, he needed a dollar for the night, and coincidentally while Morris was watching, he took a dollar out. Morris ordered Frank to leave.
- Helen goes to meet Frank in the park the same night and decides she loves him but Ward Minogue is there instead. Ward tries to rape Helen, but Frank “rescues” her from Ward and rapes her himself.
- Morris almost kills himself by leaving the gas on, and Frank and Nick save him. Frank keeps the store open while he is in the hospital. Business is much worse because the store across the road reopened (Norwegians). Frank works all night at a different place to make more money for the store. Morris comes back and demands Frank to leave again. Morris attempts to find another job but can’t. Morris attempts to burn the house down for insurance money but reconsiders it, but almost dies and Frank saves him once again. Morris orders Frank to leave once again.
- Ward accidentally sets Karp’s store on fire when he breaks in to steal liquor and it burns down (killing Ward). Karp wants to buy Morris’s store to reopen, and Morris is elated (but then he isn’t because he is afraid of change, and is honestly setting himself up for the same life but hoping that there are no consequences or challenges—> unattainable American Dream?) . He shovels snow for pedestrians (and because he wants to experience “freedom” after sitting in his store for 22 years), but doesn’t wear a coat and dies of pneumonia. He dies thinking that he did nothing useful with his life because he wasn’t able to provide a better life for his family (we can tell because of the dream with Ephraim in it)
- Frank comes back to run the store and continues to work at the other store as well. He still wants to pay for Helen’s tuition, and she’s changed and views him friendlier and accepts his offer. Frank now embraces Morris’s honesty and the store itself (and essentially turns into him). Frank gets circumcised and becomes a Jew.

Character Profiles

Frank

- Good - Strive to be better: although there are many relapses of Frank going back to bad behavior, he slowly progresses to achieve his goal of being like St. Francis of Assisi
- Bad - Lack of Honesty: initially hides the truth after he participates in holding up the store, Steal from the business rather than help himself; Lack of Responsibility for his Actions: constantly excuses his actions that violate his plan to be a better person (such as continuing to steal from the store even though he promised himself he wouldn’t and then excusing it)

Morris

- Good - Morals unchanged: even through difficult circumstances, the values and morals Morris holds don’t waver (ex. Even though he is poor, still gives to people)
- Bad - Lack of Prioritization: Gives to others at the cost of his own family and store (ex. when he lets customers go after paying less, when he cleans the pavement of snow), Stubborn, Unwilling to change his circumstances (ex. Improving the store). Also has unrealistic expectations

Ida

- Good - Inflexibility: Not willing to accept change so easily (makes sure the choice is the 100% right choice to make), provides resistance to choices Morris makes, is good bc if not for her who knows where the store would be
- Bad - Inflexibility: Resistant to change and accepting help from others even when it is in the family’s best interest (ex. when other characters suggest providing loans or investments to support the business, but Ida wants to be independent)

Helen:

- Good - Caring: even though she strives for a high education and college which may not be attainable at this point, she still constantly supports the business without argument by providing her salary to the family
- Bad - Idealistic, Unrealistic: dreams of a better life disconnected from harsh realities of family, tries to change Frank from who he actually is in her head (imagined him with a straight nose, project her college dreams onto him, etc. etc.) “I’ll wait, I’ll dream, something will happen” - doesn’t take action. She also criticizes Morris (after his death) for “not doing enough”, but that advice could also apply to her, so she is partially hypocritical
