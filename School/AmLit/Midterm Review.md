# The Great Gatsby

## Plot
## Characters

### Nick Carraway
- POV
- From midwest, Moves to NY for bond business
> *I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.*
- Honest, trustworthy, quiet
	- Gatsby and other characters confide in him
> *I’m inclined to reserve all judgements ... accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought ... intimate revelations of young men ... plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions*
- learned from his father to reserve judgment about other people, because if he holds them up to his own moral standards, he will misunderstand them
	- Characterizes himself as moral and tolerant
- Lives in West Egg (new money) but has connections in East Egg (old money)
- Gatsby and Nick - Nick describes him as someone who represents everything Nick scorns, but exempting Gatsby from his usual judgments

- Attracted to Jordan but also repelled at her lack of personality
	- Jordan's boredom at her surroundings shows her dislike of "old money"
> *Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men ... She was incurably dishonest. She wasn’t able to endure being at a disadvantage and, given this unwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard, jaunty body.*

### Jay Gatsby (James Gatz)
- Loves Daisy
	- Failed at first shot with Daisy
- "New money" - Worked for all his money
### Daisy Buchanan
> *I’m glad it’s a girl. And I hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool*
### Tom Buchanan
- Arrogant, racist
- "old money"



# Final Notes
- Comparison - Compare both characters
- Make judgements, not just plot point
	- "overly stubborn", "rejecting opportunities to change himself"
