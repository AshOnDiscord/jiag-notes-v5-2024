# 3D Coordinate System
- Use ordered triple $P(a, b, c)$
- Three axes divide space into 8 **octants**
- Choose fixed point $O$ (origin)
- Three directed lines through $O$ that are perpendicular to each other (axes)
## Right Hand Rule
- Direction of $z$-axis is determined by **right-hand rule**
	1. Curl fingers of right hand around $z$-axis, thumb points (up) in the direction of the $z$-axis

# Representing a point
- $P(a, b, c)$
- Let $a$ be the distance from $yz$-plane to $P$, let $b$ be the distance from the $xz$-plane to $P$, let $c$ be the distance from the $xy$-plane to $P$
![](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240106105737.png)

- Note that $P(a, b, c)$ also determines a **rectangular box**.
- **Projection of P onto the xy-plane** = Dropping a perpendicular from $P$ to $xy$-plane gets point $Q$ with coordinates $Q(a, b, 0)$
	- Similarly, you can have projections on the $yz$ and $xz$ planes

# Surfaces and Solids
- $x$, $y$, $z$ represent surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$

![](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240106110008.png)
- $x^2 + y^2 = 1, z =3$
![](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240106110521.png)
- $x^2 + y^2 = 1$
![](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240106110617.png)

- Solid region: $x^2 + y^2 \leq 1, 2\leq z \leq 4$
![](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240106110651.png)

- $y=x$
	- Set of all points in $\mathbb{R}^3$ whose $x$ and $y$ coords are equal

# Distance
- Distance formula extension
- Distance $|P_1P_2|$ between points $P_1(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $P_2(x_2, y_2, z_2)$ is

$$|P_1P_2| = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}$$

# Spheres
- Radius $r$ and center $C(h, k, l)$ is defined as all set of points $P(x, y, z)$ whose distance from $C$ is $r$
- $P$ is on the sphere IAOI $|PC| = r$
$$\sqrt{(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 + (z - l)^2} = r$$

![](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240106111110.png)
- Sphere has equation
$$(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 + (z - l)^2 = r^2$$
- Find equation of sphere with given **center** and **a point which it passes thru**:
	- Plug in points
	- Find $r$
